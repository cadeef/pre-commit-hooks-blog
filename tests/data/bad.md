## Hi I’m Cade, a pretty good engineer, neuroatypical, and want good things for you.

### Tech

I build massive-scale internet thingies for a living and have many opinions about it. This blog is an attempt to share them and the war stories from along the way.

If you’d like me to help build cool stuff or simply tell people no (or yes if that’s your thing) within your organization, I’m really good at it and [available for hire](mailto:cade+omgreally@e-f.me).

### Neuroatypical

[Why would I share my struggles?](/posts/on-normalizing-mental-health-issues/)

I’m diagnosed with Bipolar I. It means I occasionally have periods of sustained hyperactivity. I’ve been battling it my entire adult life, and have gotten reasonably good at detecting and responding to it. I even have a software project to monitor my behavior and poke me when I **might** be manic that I’ll share if I ever get around to cleaning up the code.

### Social

I’ve been on the internet a long time, you can find me squatting cade or cadeef most places. Some more common ones (in alphabetical order):

## Cade.pro

This website is lovingly maintained in git and statically built by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I use [Bear](https://bear.app) to author pages and export them to markdown through custom tooling. [General workflow](/posts/hugo-partial-rendering/#my-workflow). Published by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Terms of Use

These here are the terms of use; a lawyer would gag, but I’ll retain one if it gets hairy. As lawyers like to say, govern yourself accordingly:

* **Be kind.** We are all struggling to make our way in this world, empathy goes a long way.
* **Don’t be an asshole.** It’s really not that hard. Should you sling insults, don’t be surprised when I sling back.
* **If you’re an asshole, I will make it difficult to read my content.** I’m a ~15 year tech vet and remarkably good at finding solutions.

### Privacy

**This is a personal website. I will NEVER sell or otherwise intentionally disclose your data.**

**Third-party trackers are NOT in use**, however I do serve a single pixel from t.e-f.me (another personal domain) on each page to satisfy my curiosity.

**Netlify logs requests**, but I don’t currently subscribe to their analytics service and don’t foresee spending $9/month for the privilege. I’ll let you know if that changes.

**Google Webfonts are in use**, which is essentially a tracker. It will go away once I have a chance to rip them out of the theme. Avoiding Google is a losing battle, but you can disable web fonts if you’re inclined.

**Javascript is served from assorted CDNs.** Once again, I’ll serve the content directly once removed from the theme.

---

**If you prefer I never knew you were here**, block `t.e-f.me` in your browser or DNS— it will apply anywhere I use it on the net.

**I maintain a custom block list to ease avoiding my pixel** and anything I might implement in the future, which is explicitly excluded from logging (you’ll have to take my word for it), at [https://t.e-f.me/do-not-track.txt](https://t.e-f.me/do-not-track.txt). Add it to your favorite adblocker and I’ll do the right thing.

**Add a custom block list:**

* [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)

### Where are the comments?

I’ve chosen email as a feedback mechanism. I’ll usually provide a link in posts where I specifically solicit feedback.

Matter-of-fact, I have zero interest dealing with bots or your conspiracy theories. I won’t give air to ideas I find distasteful. Your screed about chemtrails, QAnon, or white nationalism is welcome but, be forewarned, I’ll publish anything I find amusing with attribution and commentary.
